# SMTP compatibility

Mail API defines an HTTP submission endpoint; it does not define an SMTP
endpoint. An SMTP-based application needs an adapter or relay that accepts an
SMTP message, converts it to an `OutboundMessageRequest`, and submits it to
`POST /v1/messages`. Conversely, a Mail API provider may use SMTP internally
for delivery, but that implementation detail is outside this specification.

## MIME message mapping

The adapter parses the SMTP message's RFC 5322/MIME content and maps it to the
HTTP request.

| SMTP data | Mail API field | Mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `From` header | `from` | Parse the visible author address and display name. Reject the submission if it is absent. |
| `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` headers | `to`, `cc`, `bcc` | Parse structured recipient headers into address lists. |
| `Reply-To` header | `replyTo` | Parse into an address list. |
| `Subject` header | `subject` | Decode and copy the header value. |
| `text/plain` MIME part | `text` | Decode the selected plain-text part. |
| `text/html` MIME part | `html` | Decode the selected HTML part. |
| Other headers | `headers` | Preserve supplemental and repeated fields in their original order. |
| Regular MIME attachments | `attachments` | Decode each body part, Base64-encode its bytes, and retain filename and media type. |

For `multipart/alternative`, preserve both selected `text/plain` and `text/html`
parts when available. Structured Mail API fields are authoritative, so an
adapter must not duplicate `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Reply-To`, or `Subject`
in `headers`.

## SMTP envelope boundary and delivery semantics

SMTP's `MAIL FROM` and `RCPT TO` commands describe the delivery envelope; they
are not necessarily the same as the visible message headers. Mail API `v1` is
an HTTP submission API rather than an SMTP relay interface, so it deliberately
does not expose a separate envelope-sender field. The provider determines its
own transport envelope.

- Use the MIME `From` header for `from`, not `MAIL FROM`.
- An adapter must define a policy for envelope recipients that are absent from
  visible `To` or `Cc` headers. They are often Bcc recipients, but cannot be
  identified reliably after a message has been composed.
- A Mail API `200` can be translated to SMTP `250` acceptance because it means
  the provider durably accepted responsibility for asynchronous processing.
  Neither result confirms final recipient delivery.
- `400`, `413`, `415`, and `422` are non-retryable unless the message is
  changed. A `409` for a matching idempotent request in progress may be retried
  later; a key used with a different payload requires a new key or payload.
  `429` and `503` are retryable and may provide `Retry-After`; other `5xx`
  responses require an adapter retry policy. A request timeout without an
  `Idempotency-Key` remains an unknown-outcome condition, as it does in SMTP
  when an acceptance response is lost.

## Unsupported or policy-dependent content

- Inline MIME attachments using content IDs have no Mail API `v1` equivalent.
  The adapter should reject them or define a documented transformation rather
  than send HTML with broken `cid:` references.
- SMTP authentication, TLS, client identity, retry scheduling, size limits,
  and rate limits are deployment concerns. Mail API standardizes only the HTTP
  response meaning for submission failures.
- Inbound Mail API examples are received-message data representations only;
  they do not define an SMTP receiving service or webhook endpoint.
